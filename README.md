##  Executive Summary

This repository contains the foundational MATLAB framework for **Symmetry-Constrained Zero-Noise Extrapolation (SC-ZNE)**, a novel algorithmic error mitigation technique designed to solve linearized aeroelastic systems on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. 

While quantum algorithms (e.g., HHL) offer exponential speedups for solving the $O(N^3)$ classical Navier-Stokes and structural coupling equations, current quantum hardware suffers from decoherence and gate errors. This framework bypasses the need for fault-tolerant hardware by enforcing the physical symmetries of the Aerodynamic Influence Coefficient (AIC) matrix during the error extrapolation phase, ensuring the quantum output remains strictly Hermitian, positive-definite, and certifiable for active wing morphing and flutter suppression.

## 🛑 The Engineering Bottleneck

In real-time Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) and active wing morphing, the flight control computer must solve $Ax = b$ at kHz frequencies, where $A$ is the coupled aeroelastic matrix. 

| The Quantum Promise | The NISQ Reality |
| :--- | :--- |
| Quantum linear solvers can theoretically process millions of data points simultaneously, achieving $O(\log N)$ complexity. | Current quantum processors exhibit high error rates (depolarizing noise, thermal relaxation). |
| Enables real-time, high-fidelity aerodynamic simulations previously impossible on classical supercomputers. | Standard Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) yields unphysical results (e.g., negative aerodynamic damping), violating strict aerospace certification requirements (DO-178C). |

##  The SC-ZNE Solution

Our approach introduces a **physics-informed constraint** to the standard Richardson extrapolation used in ZNE. By recognizing that the aeroelastic operator $A$ is inherently Hermitian and positive-definite, we constrain the extrapolation polynomial to preserve these physical invariants. 

1. **Noise Scaling:** The quantum circuit is executed at scaled noise factors ($\lambda = 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5$).
2. **Observable Measurement:** The wingtip morphing command (a specific physical observable) is measured.
3. **Symmetry-Constrained Extrapolation:** A constrained polynomial fit extrapolates the results to $\lambda = 0$ (zero noise), mathematically guaranteeing that the output state remains within the physical bounds of the aeroelastic operator.

##  System Architecture

The MATLAB script is structured into five distinct engineering phases:

1. **Aerospace Physics Generation:** Constructs a realistic, symmetric, positive-definite Aerodynamic Influence Coefficient (AIC) matrix and normalizes the sensor input vector.
2. **NISQ Noise Modeling:** Implements a global depolarizing noise channel using Kronecker products of Pauli matrices to simulate realistic NISQ decoherence.
3. **Hamiltonian Evolution:** Simulates the core HHL algorithm step: unitary evolution $U = e^{-iAt}$ under the aeroelastic Hamiltonian.
4. **Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE):** Executes the circuit at $\lambda \in \{1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5\}$ and extracts the expectation value of the wingtip displacement observable.
5. **Symmetry-Constrained Richardson Extrapolation:** Fits a 2nd-degree polynomial to the $\lambda$ data points and evaluates at $\lambda = 0$, enforcing physical bounds.
